# matlab-GUI-blinking-exponential
Matlab GUI for photoluminescence (PL) blinking analysis of quantum dots (QDs) featuring mono-exponential ON- and OFF- time distributions

This project is a MATLAB GUI useful for the analysis of PL blinking traces of QDs featuring mono-exponential blinking statistics. The GUI helps analysing each dot and allows to save information related to good blinking dots only. In the future, I would like to implement the possibility to save the current state of analysis.
